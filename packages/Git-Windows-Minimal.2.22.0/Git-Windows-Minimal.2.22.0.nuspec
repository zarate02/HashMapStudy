    <description>Git for Windows focuses on offering a lightweight, native set of tools that bring the full feature set of the Git to Windows while providing appropriate user interfaces for experienced users.

Minimal Git for Windows is a reduced sized package designed to support application integration (like integrated development environments, graph visualizers, etc.) where full console support (colorization, pagniation, etc.) is not needed. Additionally, non-critical packages such as Git-Bash, Git-Gui, PERL, Python, and Tcl are excluded from Minimal Git for Windows to reduce the package size.</description>
